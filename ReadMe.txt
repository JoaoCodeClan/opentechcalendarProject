To run the application:

Copy project to a Folder of your choice. On command line travel to that folder and then run:

  1-npm install



    This will install all the dependencies present on this project.

This project uses two ports , port 5000 for backend and port 3000 for front end;
If you are using these ports for something else you need to change them on the package.json for front end ( in client/) and for back end( current folder);
When ready run:

  2- npm run dev

    This will run both the back and front end at the same time using the same command line window.


A browser window will open on localhost:3000 and you will be able to use the application.
